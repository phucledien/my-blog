          ðŸ‘‹ Xin chÃ o, I'm Oliver. This is the place, where I would share the
          things I'm learning, projects I did and been working on, and maybe
          just some random thoughts. Moreover, the idea of having my own space
          on the internet is kinda fun.
          <p>
            Everything here is my own opinion, take it with a grain of salt!
